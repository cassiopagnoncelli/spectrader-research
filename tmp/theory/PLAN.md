## Models

- [x] ~~K-means classfication~~
- [ ] [**Gaussian Mixture Model**](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/mixture-models-in-r) (clustering: mixtools, bayesmix, EMCluster, flexmix)
- [ ] [**Extreme Gradient Boosting**](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/extreme-gradient-boosting-with-xgboost)
- [x] ~~Markov Model~~
- [ ] Hidden Markov Model
- [ ] Kalman Filter
- [-] Temporal Convolutional Network (~~CNN, RNN~~)
- [ ] SVM classification & regression
- [-] [Generalized Linear Models](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/generalized-linear-models-in-r) (glmnet)
- [-] Kohonen's SOM

**Packages**: ~~[x] forecast (TBATS, ETS, HW, MSTS, ARFIMA, STL)~~, [-] AWS AutoGluon (Python), [x] FB Prophet

## Ensembles

Homogeneous
- [x] ~~Bagging: parallel/voting~~
- [x] ~~Boosting: chaining the same model on errors~~

Heterogeneous
- [x] ~~Voting: each classifier votes for a class~~
- [x] ~~Cascading: when model is not so sure about the result, cascades to another model recursively~~
- [x] Stacking: meta-learner like genderguess, a model orchestrating based on underyling models predictions; trains on OOF

## Simulation, Optimization

- [x] ~~Monte Carlo simulation~~

**Packages**: ~~[x] optim, [x] pso, [x] simmulated annealing~~

## Option Pricing

## Volatility Analysis

- [x] ~~ARCH: current volatility is a linear comb of past (squared) errors~~
- [x] ~~[GARCH](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/garch-models-in-r): like ARCH but autoregress on past volatilities~~
- [x] ~~MSGARCH - Regime Switching GARCH~~
